# Programming-Guidance

This repository is a small amateur-guide of mine to summarize certain explanations of programming concepts, terminologies and habits.
I summarize this mainly for myself and for people I want to help out, so don't expect any deep meanings or plans or even professional documentation. 

On the same note: Please keep in mind, I research certain topics and look for good and clear ways to understand possibly-complex things. 
In this repository I will reference and make use of suiting statements and articles and I add my own comments and thoughts to it in order to sort things out. Have a nice day! :)
