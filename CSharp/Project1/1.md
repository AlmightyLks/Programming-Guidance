### <a id="Title">Project 1</a>

Okay, let's get started with your project. :)<br>
First you need to [create a project](../Your-First-Project.md).<br>
Don't forget, console application, C#.<br>
For this purpose you could call it "Project1", because this project is just meant to get to know some things.<br>

#### <a id="Program">Your Program</a>

Once you've created your console app, you will see a Program.cs file in your project folder.<br>
That's the program-entrance of your program. Your program will always start in the pre-made "Main" method.<br>
And everything we will do for now, has to be within the curly bracket { } of the Main-method.<br>

#### <a id="Program">Variables</a>

If you have absolutely no idea what data types are, you can take a look at [this](../../General-Programming/Data-Types.md).<br>
Okay. Simply put, the way you create variables is pretty much always the same.<br>

```csharp
[DataType] [VariableName] = [Value];
```
So for creating string variables you would do this:<br>
```csharp
string foo = "bar";
```
You can also only declare a variable, without giving it a value. But that causes problem if you try to get its value when it has none. But it can be used to create your set of variables in advance, useful in some situations :)<br>
```csharp
string foo;

foo = "bar";
```
