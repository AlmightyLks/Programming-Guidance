#### <a id="Program">Variables and Methods</a>

Sooo. Let's do something...<br>
Create a variable for the username and give it whatever value you want. You can use your own name if you'd like. :)<br>
Then create another variable. This variable is for your age. You can guess the data type. :P<br>

```csharp
string username = "Peter";
int age = 20;
```

Now print both out with Console.WriteLine();.
```csharp
string username = "Peter";
int age = 20;
Console.WriteLine(username);
Console.WriteLine(age);
```

Awesome!<br>
But... Let's make this a little more interesting...<br><br>

You can add variables and strings together to get one bigger string. :)<br>
You simply do that by adding your strings/variables with a plus sign.<br>
Just like that:
```csharp
string username = "Peter";
int age = 20;
Console.WriteLine("Welcome, " + username + " you are " + age + " years old, right?");
```

Again! Awesome!<br>
We're getting closer and closer...<br>

#### <a id="Program">Flexibility</a>

Your code isn't always going to be using hardcoded data.<br>
Make it flexible to whatever input.<br>
Here we will make it flexible to whatever the user enters.<br>
Our next task:<br>
Prompt the user to enter their name and age and welcome them using those infos.<br>

Advice:<br>
- Make use of pre-made methods :P<br>
- Might as well tell you which tools to use... Console.ReadLine(); & Console.WriteLine(); :)<br><br>

If you're having difficulties, try looking up what each of those methods do and google your way through till you get your desired result.<br>
It's fine to look up things. Just try to make sense out of it. :)<br>
