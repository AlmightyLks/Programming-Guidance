### <a id="Title">Your First Project</a>

Now we will get to creating your first project. :)<br>
I don't know with what intention you came here.<br>
But please listen to me when I tell you to learn C# with Console Applications.<br>
That's how it is recommended to do and you might one day see why...<br>
The approach is a little different depending on your OS: Windows / Mac / Linux<br>
Or to say it in another way, depending on your coding environment, Visual Studio Community / Visual Studio Code.<br>
So let's split this up a little...<br>

Oh, and to avoid any further confusion. When speaking of your application, it is basically the same as your project.<br>
