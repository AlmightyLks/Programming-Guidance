Now we will get to creating your first project. :)<br>
I don't know with what intention you came here.<br>
But please listen to me when I tell you to learn C# with Console Applications.<br>
That's how it is recommended to do and you might one day see why...<br>

Oh, and to avoid any further confusion. When speaking of your application, it is basically the same as your project.<br>

In order to create a project you simply have to click on "Create a new project"<br><br>
When doing so you should see something like this:<br><br>
