# General-Programming

### <a id="Title">The Beginning</a>

Welcome to my first programming language-dedicated documentation. :)<br>
I will be going through the setup of a proper coding environment for either your <a href="#Win">Windows</a> or <a href="#Lin">Linux</a> machine. <br>
I do not have any experience with Mac OS at all but as to my knowledge, it is similar to the procedure of setting it up on Windows.<br>
Sooo let's get started! :)<br>

## <a id="Win">Windows</a>

#### <a id="IDE">Programming Environment | IDE</a>

In advance before installing this, you will have to ideally install two things.<br>
Just install the as "recommended" marked versions of each: <br>
[.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) ("Developer Pack") & [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) ("SDK X.X.XXX")<br>
Those two things are so called Frameworks. Frameworks for programming languages are just special sets of given pre-made methods and just all kind of things.<br>
.NET Framework -> To create Windows Applications<br>
.NET Core -> To create Crossplatform Applications<br>

Okay. First, you need your enviroment to program in. Your **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment. <br>
What is so special about an IDE? It's a program to write programs. A pretty nice program.<br>
All you need for programming is integrated into that program for you. <br>
In example your code editor, a file explorer, your programming language's compiler, and so on...<br>

The creators of C#, Microsoft, also created a suiting IDE for it.<br>
Visual Studio (Community / Professional / Enterprise).<br>
Don't worry about the different types of that IDE.<br>
Community is free. You only need to login with a microsoft account within the first 30 days, after the first month of "testing" you're obligated to be logged in. But besides that it's free.<br>
Throughout my documentation I will be referencing to features and options within Visual Studio.<br>
You can get it [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

While installing Visual Studio you will be prompted for the workloads about as shown here: <br>
<img height="300px" width="auto" src="../Media/CSharp/Workloads.png">
<br>
<br>
All you need to select here is ".NET desktop development" and install that workload with Visual Studio.<br>
In future you can add other workload as well, but in order to learn C#, that's really all you need.<br>
<br>

When done, congratulations :) You've setup up your proper C# coding environment.<br>
Now you can begin with the programming language itself.<br>

#### <a id="IDE">Programming Environment | Code Editor</a>

.NET Core -> To create Crossplatform Applications<br>

Unlike for Windows, Linux sadly has a limited support for C#. The IDE, Visual Studio, is unfortunately only available for Windows & Mac OS.<br>
Though through the on-going support for the .NET Core framework and the community, you can also program .NET Core Applications with various normal Code Editors.<br>
In my documentation I will be using either Visual Studio, which is unavailable for Linux, or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is by the way also free, even without needing a connected microsoft account.<br>
It might seem similar to Visual Studio, but keep in mind. It has a reason why experienced people call Visual Studio Code "just a fancy code editor". :)<br>
It lacks some useful features which the IDE has.<br>

After installing Visual Studio Code you: <br>
