### The First Steps

You might or might not have taken a look at programming before when you read this.<br>
You might or might not have gotten an idea on how some things look, work or maybe even have to be done.<br>
I am neither here to judge nor to correct you on what you already know.<br>
I just hope you can take a look at this and get an idea on how to start off programming.<br>

#### What is programming? | What do you really do when you program?

* *Programming is a way to “instruct the computer to perform various tasks”.*<br>
  *“Instruct the computer”:* this basically means that you provide the computer a set of instructions that are          written in a language that the computer can understand.
* Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. These instructions   are known as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task.
  The end goal is to create something: that could mean anything from a web page, or a piece of software, or even       just a pretty picture. That’s why computer programming is often described as a mix between art and science; it's     technical and analytical, yet creative at the same time.

These described instructions are simply-put given pre-made lines of code, which you can use for whatever you want. <br>
To perhaps get a clearer look at what is meant by those "pre-made lines of code" or "instructions", let's take a look at this python code:

```python
print("Hello World")
```
When executing this line of code, you will see the two word "Hello World" in your console window. Without any hustle you just wrote your first working line of code. Awesome!

Okay, you might have tried this in your command prompt by now or maybe you even already know that it doesn't just work out of the box. :)
