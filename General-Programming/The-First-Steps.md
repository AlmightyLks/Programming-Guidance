### <a id="Title">The First Steps</a>

You might or might not have taken a look at programming before when you read this.<br>
You might or might not have gotten an idea on how some things look, work or maybe even have to be done.<br>
I am neither here to judge nor to correct you on what you already know.<br>
I just hope you can take a look at this and get an idea on how to start off programming.<br>

#### <a id="Programming">What is programming? | What do you really do when you program?</a>

> * *Programming is a way to “instruct the computer to perform various tasks”.*<br>
    *“Instruct the computer”:* this basically means that you provide the computer a set of instructions that are          written in a language that the computer can understand.
> * Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. These instructions are known as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task.
  The end goal is to create something: that could mean anything from a web page, or a piece of software, or even       just a pretty picture. That’s why computer programming is often described as a mix between art and science; it's     technical and analytical, yet creative at the same time.

These described instructions are simply-put given pre-made lines of code, which you can use for whatever you want. <br>
To perhaps get a clearer look at what is meant by those "pre-made lines of code" or "instructions", let's take a look at this python code:

```python
print("Hello World")
```
When executing this line of code, you will see the two words "Hello World" in your console window. Without any hustle you just wrote your first working line of code. Awesome!

Okay, you might have tried this in your command prompt by now or maybe you even already know that it doesn't just work out of the box. :)<br>
I will get to [that](https://github.com/AlmightyLks/Programming-Guidance/blob/master/General-Programming/The-First-Steps.md#OutOfTheBox) later.

#### <a id="Use">What can programming be used for? | What is it used for?</a>

Every electronical device, has some kind of program on them. Even cars have programs on their chipsets.<br>
And as you migh have heard, the self driving car from Tesla, lead by Elon Musk, was a programmatically breakthrough!<br>
The "miracle" of self-driving cars is the result of a well thought out program. :)
Okay, let's take a step back from those big things. <br>
Your computer or your phone. They run software, their operating system. And everything you can do on it, was programmed for you. :)<br>
If we once again take one more step back. Do you have a calculator laying around from school, university or your office? It's a bit of plastic, maybe a little bit of glass and a bit of metal inside of it. You press a button and it appears on the screen. Kind of as if the numbers have the code
```python
print(num)
```
behind the scenes...<br>
And to get straight to the point. Yes, even a calculator runs a program.<br>
A computer calculator is a perfect example for understanding what programming can do, what it is, what it does and what you can even set yourself as a starting-project! :)<br>
You can get to know so many programming topics and fields within a language with a simple calculator.<br>


Now, you know a bit more about programming itself and where it appears in your everyday life.<br>
And to finally set your first steps into programming, you now need to know how to starts with programming languages. <br>

#### <a id="ProgrammingLanguages">Which programming languages are there? | Why are there so many? | Which programming language should I choose?</a>

> * *The total number of computer languages to exist is approximately 9,000, though there are 50 that are the most       popular programming languages in use today.*
>  *  TIOBE - 250<br>
      Wikipedia - 700<br>
      FOLDOC - 1,000<br>
      The Language List - 2,500<br>
>  * So the first reason why there’s a lot of languages is because people keep creating them, even when they don’t       really need to.  Another reason is because some languages are much better suited to certain tasks than others.       Some programming languages are also much easier to learn than others.

To make it short:<br>
There are more programming languages than you could think of. Enough to be busy learning for a lifetime and further.<br>
As stated above, one of the reasons for so many programming languages being out there is that some languages are just made and optimized for specific tasks and fields such as data processing or game development.<br>

And you might think yourself "Which language is 'future-proof'?", "Which language is worth learning?". Don't worry about that. Actual programming is not about trends. Programming is about the mindset, knowledge and experience. You can have knowledge in C# and use this knowledge in Javascript, for example. Or your can use your Java knowledge in C#. The language doesn't matter. It's always the same, just different syntax. So all you really need to get into is your specific type and area of programming. We will get to that now.<br>

Now there's still the question of which language you will finally choose. Like I said, languages are usually made for *something*, a specific task, field or style. Try things out and start slow and easy. Let me give you some examples on what fields of programming typically use which programming languages.<br>

* Web Development
  * Front end (What you see visually on the website)
    - HTML & CSS
    - Javascript
  * Back end (The processing of data with algorithms and such)
    - PHP
    - Javascript (NodeJs)
* Desktop Development (Applications & Games)
  - C#
  - C++
  - Python
  - Java
* Mobile Development
  - Python
  - Java
  - C++
* Embedded Development (Depending on *what* you program for) 
  - Python
  - C++
  - C
  - Assembly Language

From personal experience and knowledge I can tell you that embedded programming and mobile developoment are the rather complicated ones and not really beginner-friendly. Generally, I can tell you a few wide-spread and universal programming languages though:

* Javascript
* Python
* C#

These are definetly not wrong to pick up.<br>

<a id="OutOfTheBox">And to answer the mystery of *why it doesn't just work out of the box*:<br></a>
Usually, you need to install a compiler/intepreter on your computer first.<br>
Something that knows what your programming language's instructions mean.<br>
For that you should follow the hundreds and hundred of actual step-by-step guides and tutorials online explaining everything you need to know.

Last but not least:<br>
Please let me tell you. <br>
You can have an ultimate goal, i.e. creating your own video game, but please take it slow & easy. We all began with a simple "Hello World". :)<br>
It has a reason why proper games are always backed up by either a great development team or time and money.<br>
You won't learn a whole programming language within a short amount of time. You will have to put patience, passion and dedication into it. <br>
And trust me. People won't learn a language for you. But if you show those 3 traits, programmers will always be welcome to help you out with questions, just don't forget, be accurate and think out of the box. :P
